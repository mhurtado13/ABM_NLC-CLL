Cell Hypothesis Rules (detailed)

In cancer cells:
contact with NLCs decreases migration speed from 2 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.5 and Hill power 10.
damage increases transform to apoptotic from 8e-05 towards 0.0008 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.5 and Hill power 4.
antiapoptotic decreases transform to apoptotic from 8e-05 towards 8e-10 with a Hill response, with half-max 2.5 and Hill power 10.

In monocytes cells:
stress increases phagocytose apoptotic from 2.5 towards 5 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 8.
stress increases phagocytose dead from 2.5 towards 5 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 8.
cytokines increases transform to macrophages from 2e-12 towards 0.0003 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 5.
intracellular stress increases transform to NLCs from 3e-15 towards 0.0001 with a Hill response, with half-max 3200 and Hill power 10.
intracellular cytokines increases transform to NLCs from 3e-15 towards 0.0001 with a Hill response, with half-max 25000 and Hill power 10.

In macrophages cells:
stress increases phagocytose apoptotic from 9.2 towards 20 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 8.
stress increases phagocytose dead from 9.2 towards 20 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 8.
intracellular stress increases transform to NLCs from 3e-16 towards 0.0001 with a Hill response, with half-max 3200 and Hill power 10.
intracellular cytokines increases transform to NLCs from 3e-16 towards 0.0001 with a Hill response, with half-max 25000 and Hill power 10.

In NLCs cells:
stress increases phagocytose apoptotic from 0.4 towards 2 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 8.
stress increases phagocytose dead from 0.4 towards 2 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 8.
contact with cancer increases antiapoptotic secretion from 1 towards 5 with a Hill response, with half-max 1 and Hill power 50.
