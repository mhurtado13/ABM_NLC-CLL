Cell Hypothesis Rules

In cancer cells:
contact with NLCs decreases migration speed
damage increases transform to apoptotic
antiapoptotic decreases transform to apoptotic

In monocytes cells:
stress increases phagocytose apoptotic
stress increases phagocytose dead
cytokines increases transform to macrophages
intracellular stress increases transform to NLCs
intracellular cytokines increases transform to NLCs

In macrophages cells:
stress increases phagocytose apoptotic
stress increases phagocytose dead
intracellular stress increases transform to NLCs
intracellular cytokines increases transform to NLCs

In NLCs cells:
stress increases phagocytose apoptotic
stress increases phagocytose dead
contact with cancer increases antiapoptotic secretion

In apoptotic cells:

In dead cells:
