<body><h1>Cell Hypothesis Rules (detailed)</h1>
<p>In cancer cells:
<ul>
<li>contact with NLCs decreases migration speed from 2 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.5 and Hill power 10.</li>
<li>damage increases transform to apoptotic from 8e-05 towards 0.0008 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.5 and Hill power 4.</li>
<li>antiapoptotic decreases transform to apoptotic from 8e-05 towards 8e-10 with a Hill response, with half-max 2.5 and Hill power 10.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In monocytes cells:
<ul>
<li>stress increases phagocytose apoptotic from 2.5 towards 5 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 8.</li>
<li>stress increases phagocytose dead from 2.5 towards 5 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 8.</li>
<li>cytokines increases transform to macrophages from 2e-12 towards 0.0003 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 5.</li>
<li>intracellular stress increases transform to NLCs from 3e-15 towards 0.0001 with a Hill response, with half-max 3200 and Hill power 10.</li>
<li>intracellular cytokines increases transform to NLCs from 3e-15 towards 0.0001 with a Hill response, with half-max 25000 and Hill power 10.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In macrophages cells:
<ul>
<li>stress increases phagocytose apoptotic from 9.2 towards 20 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 8.</li>
<li>stress increases phagocytose dead from 9.2 towards 20 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 8.</li>
<li>intracellular stress increases transform to NLCs from 3e-16 towards 0.0001 with a Hill response, with half-max 3200 and Hill power 10.</li>
<li>intracellular cytokines increases transform to NLCs from 3e-16 towards 0.0001 with a Hill response, with half-max 25000 and Hill power 10.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In NLCs cells:
<ul>
<li>stress increases phagocytose apoptotic from 0.4 towards 2 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 8.</li>
<li>stress increases phagocytose dead from 0.4 towards 2 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 8.</li>
<li>contact with cancer increases antiapoptotic secretion from 1 towards 5 with a Hill response, with half-max 1 and Hill power 50.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In apoptotic cells:

<p>In dead cells:
