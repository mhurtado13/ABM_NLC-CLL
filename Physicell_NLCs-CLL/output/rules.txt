Cell Hypothesis Rules

In cancer cells cells:
pressure decreases cycle entry
anti-apoptotic factor decreases transform to apoptotic

In monocytes cells:
pressure decreases cycle entry
time increases transform to macrophages

In macrophages cells:
time increases transform to NLCs

In NLCs cells:

In apoptotic cells:
dead increases debris secretion
