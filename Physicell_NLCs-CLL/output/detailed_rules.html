<body><h1>Cell Hypothesis Rules (detailed)</h1>
<p>In cancer cells cells:
<ul>
<li>pressure decreases cycle entry from 0 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 1 and Hill power 4.</li>
<li>anti-apoptotic factor decreases transform to apoptotic from 5e-05 towards 5e-06 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.5 and Hill power 10.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In monocytes cells:
<ul>
<li>pressure decreases cycle entry from 0 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 1 and Hill power 4.</li>
<li>time increases transform to macrophages from 0 towards 0.0005 with a Hill response, with half-max 2940 and Hill power 30.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In macrophages cells:
<ul>
<li>time increases transform to NLCs from 0 towards 0.0005 with a Hill response, with half-max 3000 and Hill power 30.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In NLCs cells:
<ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In apoptotic cells:
<ul>
<li>dead increases debris secretion from 1 towards 1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.5 and Hill power 20. Rule applies to dead cells.</li>
</ul>
