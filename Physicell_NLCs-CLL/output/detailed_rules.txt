Cell Hypothesis Rules (detailed)

In cancer cells cells:
pressure decreases cycle entry from 0 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 1 and Hill power 4.
anti-apoptotic factor decreases transform to apoptotic from 5e-05 towards 5e-06 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.5 and Hill power 10.

In monocytes cells:
pressure decreases cycle entry from 0 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 1 and Hill power 4.
time increases transform to macrophages from 0 towards 0.0005 with a Hill response, with half-max 2940 and Hill power 30.

In macrophages cells:
time increases transform to NLCs from 0 towards 0.0005 with a Hill response, with half-max 3000 and Hill power 30.

In NLCs cells:

In apoptotic cells:
dead increases debris secretion from 1 towards 1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.5 and Hill power 20. Rule applies to dead cells.
